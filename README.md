# YOLOv12 Training Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once version 12), a state-of-the-art object detection model that achieves both lower latency and higher accuracy compared to its predecessors. [1]

## Key Features
- Enhanced detection accuracy, especially for small objects [2]
- Improved processing speed and reduced latency [1]
- Advanced attention mechanisms for better feature extraction [4]
- Support for multiple tasks including detection, classification, and segmentation [3]

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- PyTorch 2.6.0+
- CUDA compatible GPU
- Ultralytics 8.3.x
- Roboflow (for dataset management)

## Installation
```bash
pip install roboflow
pip install -U ultralytics
pip install -U ipywidgets
```

## Dataset Preparation
1. Create a Roboflow account
2. Upload and annotate your dataset
3. Export in YOLO format
4. Download using the Roboflow pip package

## Training Configuration
```python
!yolo train data="path/to/data.yaml" \
    model=yolo12x.pt \
    epochs=1000 \
    device=0 \
    batch=8 \
    workers=4 \
    seed=101 \
    patience=300
```

## Model Architecture
YOLOv12 incorporates:
- Advanced CNN backbone with attention mechanisms [4]
- Multi-scale feature detection [2]
- Improved loss functions for better convergence [1]
- Enhanced small object detection capabilities [2]

## Performance Metrics
- Faster inference speed compared to previous versions
- Higher mAP (mean Average Precision) on COCO dataset
- Improved small object detection accuracy
- Better performance in real-world applications [1], [2]

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakibAhmedShuva/YOLOv12-Training.git
cd YOLOv12-Training
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your dataset using Roboflow

4. Start training
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolo12x.pt')
results = model.train(data="path/to/data.yaml", epochs=1000)
```
